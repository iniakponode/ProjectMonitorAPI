Unzip the file
Open the the unzipped folder
rightclick and open with Gitbash

go to phpmyadmin to create a ne database, name it projectmngtb
don't creat tables, just the database is what is needed, API will generate the tables when you run the server

type-> uvicorn main:app and hit the enter button to run the server
When the serverstarts running, copy and paste http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs on your browser to open the api and it's documentation

You read the documentation to see which endpoint is for which, and what fileds are needed and required for every endpoint.

I will still work on the roles side later, but what we have now should enable you showcase what we want to demonstrate to anybody.
report any errors you encounter to me later.
